# Process Plan - Team 22

## 1 Introduction

The customer, a teacher, would like a software tool that will help her students analyze their essays for sentence length. The students will use the information to improve wordy sentence structure.
- The input to the software will be a raw text file.
- The software should run at the command line using Java with the file path (required), a list of delimiters (optional), or word length limit (also optional) specified.
- The output should be average number of words per sentence.
- In the case of errors when processing the file, helpful messages will be provided to the user.
